# Car-Price-Performance-Insights-Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing car price and performance metrics using a dataset stored in a CSV file. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, and an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key insights. The dashboard provides an overview of various factors affecting car pricing, mileage, distribution, and other parameters.

## Analysis Performed

### Filtering and Data Processing:

The dataset was cleaned and structured for analysis. Filters were applied to analyze car performance based on fuel type and the number of doors.

### Data Visualization:

**Price Analysis**: Maximum, minimum, and average prices of cars were compared across different brands.

**Car Distribution**: The number of cars manufactured over different years was plotted to observe trends.

**Brand-Based Count**: The count of cars from various brands and models was visualized.

**Mileage Analysis**: The average mileage of cars was analyzed based on brands.

**Transmission Type Analysis**: The impact of transmission type (Automatic, Manual, Semi-Automatic) on the average cost of cars was studied.

## Key Findings

**Car Pricing Trends**: Hyundai had the highest maximum price among brands, while other brands had varying price distributions.

**Brand Popularity**: Volkswagen, Toyota, and Ford had the highest number of car models in the dataset.

**Mileage Insights**: Honda had the highest average mileage among all brands, while Mercedes had the lowest.

**Transmission Impact**: Automatic transmission cars were generally more expensive than manual and semi-automatic cars.

**Market Trends**: The number of cars manufactured each year showed a fluctuating trend with a slight increase in recent years.

## Tools Used

**Microsoft Excel** for data analysis and visualization.

**Pivot Tables and Charts** for summarizing and analyzing data.

**Filtering and Sorting techniques** to extract meaningful insights.
